# Interview Readiness Training Leaf

This is the dedicated practice module under the Fit-Focused Job Search parent.

Use it for SQL, Python/pandas, statistics, experimentation, ML/model evaluation, case/design reasoning, technical explanations, and structured interview communication.

Keep job discovery, resumes, applications, and networking in the parent workflow.

Read `training.md` only when the parent needs the broader readiness framework; this leaf owns live practice state and question continuity.

## Boundary and routing contract

The parent may pass only a target role family, imminent interview surface, readiness gap, available practice time, and approved practice data/schema.

Return only a compact readiness signal: competency practiced, question number reached, independence/score, unresolved gap, next question, and readiness signal. Do not independently search for jobs, submit applications, edit resumes, send outreach, change calendar events, or infer private career data that the parent did not pass.

## Training objective

Build interview readiness through cumulative practice rather than isolated questions.

Optimize for:
- independence;
- correct reasoning;
- transfer to unseen variants;
- clean explanation;
- durable continuity across sessions.

## Live practice default

Use one question at a time.

For each question:
1. state the durable question number;
2. show only the active schema/context needed;
3. ask the question without a solution;
4. wait for the attempt;
5. review the attempt;
6. identify the most important strength and correction;
7. offer a retry if the issue is conceptual or structural;
8. record the result;
9. continue to the next durable question number.

Do not restart numbering in a continued sequence.

## Session-state authority

Before generating any question, read the user-approved private checkpoint when it is available; otherwise read `../question-bank/session-state.yaml`. Then read the active dataset entry in `../question-bank/schema-registry.md`.

Use the `active_topic` in session state to read only that topic's `covered/` and `future/` folders under `../question-bank/<topic>/`. Keep each topic's attempted questions and planned questions separate; never treat a planned question as history.

The state must contain:
- last question reached;
- next question;
- active dataset;
- recent covered patterns;
- unresolved gaps;
- intended next progression.

When source conversation evidence conflicts with stored state:
- prefer the most recent explicit practice evidence;
- repair the stored state;
- never invent missing historical prompts.

An incomplete/partial final question still defines the stopping point.

## Schema isolation

Use only the tables and columns explicitly listed for the active dataset.

Never borrow a table from another historical schema.

If a requested practice pattern needs an unavailable table, adapt the exercise to the active schema or define a new synthetic dataset explicitly before using it. Never silently borrow a table or column from a historical dataset.

## Evidence and progression

Scores:
- 5: independent/excellent;
- 4: pass with minor refinement;
- 3: partial;
- 2: substantive help;
- 1: major gap/not answered.

Status:
- 1–3 = REPEAT
- 4–5 = PASS

Progression:
- score 1–3 → new comparable retry on next appropriate practice day;
- score 4 → transfer variant after roughly two practice days;
- score 5 → harder/transfer variant after roughly three practice days;
- difficulty increases only after two independent passes on the pattern including one transfer;
- any regression reopens the skill.

Coached work is never mastery.

## Priority order for the next question

1. unfinished current question;
2. direct continuation of the current session pattern;
3. due retry from scores 1–3;
4. due transfer from a score 4–5;
5. upcoming interview requirement;
6. new topic only when the current foundation is stable.

Continuity beats novelty.

## Current handoff state

At the time this leaf was packaged:
- last user-confirmed SQL question reached: Q49;
- next question: Q50;
- recent sequence emphasized transformations, NULLs, LEFT JOIN behavior when match coverage differs, aggregation grain, derived row-level metrics, date transformations, and aggregate → metric → LAG;
- the tracker captured Q44–Q48 but omitted Q49;
- Q49’s exact prompt must be recovered from source history if it is ever archived; do not fabricate it.

## Cross-domain roadmap

Keep the question bank organized by topic: `sql`, `python`, `ml`, `statistics`, `llm`, `design`, `case`, `communication`, and `other`. Each topic owns `covered/` for verified attempts and `future/` for planned questions. Add a topic only when it has a real practice need; do not create fictional covered history.

### SQL
Prioritize:
- aggregation grain;
- CASE/conditional metrics;
- INNER vs LEFT vs anti-join;
- NULL behavior;
- CTE/subquery structure;
- dates;
- transformations;
- row-level derived metric → aggregate;
- ranking and Top-N;
- LAG/LEAD;
- running windows;
- realistic business metrics.

### Python/pandas
Prioritize:
- loops, conditions, counters, accumulators;
- lists/dictionaries/strings/functions;
- filtering;
- groupby/agg;
- merge;
- missing data;
- calculated columns;
- ranking/window-style operations;
- small reusable metric functions;
- complexity explanation where relevant.

### Statistics / experimentation
Prioritize:
- sampling and bias;
- probability/distributions;
- confidence intervals;
- p-values and Type I/II;
- power;
- A/B design;
- guardrails;
- multiple comparisons;
- practical vs statistical significance.

### ML / model evaluation
Prioritize:
- supervised vs unsupervised vs self-supervised;
- train/validation/test;
- overfitting and remedies;
- regularization;
- leakage;
- imbalance;
- precision/recall/F1;
- ROC-AUC vs PR-AUC;
- threshold trade-offs;
- calibration;
- subgroup metrics;
- distribution shift;
- offline vs production evaluation;
- error analysis.

### Case / design
Use compact end-to-end structure:
target → data → features → baseline/model → metric + guardrails → FP/FN costs → offline evaluation → launch criteria → monitoring → failure diagnosis.

## External validation

Internal chat practice is the training system.

Use external interview-style sources only as validation of unseen transfer:
- DataLemur;
- StrataScratch;
- LeetCode SQL medium/hard.

Do not copy proprietary wording verbatim.

## End-of-session checkpoint

Always persist:
- date;
- domain;
- last question reached;
- last-question status;
- next question;
- active dataset;
- covered patterns;
- still-weak patterns;
- continuation instruction.

Write detailed, real-session checkpoints to the local gitignored `private-practice/` area after every session. Keep the tracked `question-bank/session-state.yaml` as a sanitized baseline only; update it only with genericized information that is safe to publish. A next private session must be reconstructable from its private checkpoint alone.
